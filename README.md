# PWC Templates

This repository contains templates associated with each lab assignment associated with Principles of Wireless Communications.

Each folder contains the following resources:
- A PDF copy of the lab assignment and rubric
- A README containing the following information:
  - Pointers to and explanations of the provided functions associated with each assignment
  - Function signatures for functions not included with the assignment that students need to implement
  - Any other information useful for completing the lab

By the end of each assignment, please add:
- High-level scripts needed to orchestrate the lab (such as a simulation script or scripts to prepare transmit files/process receive files)
- Additional functions in the *Functions/* folder needed to realize the functionality outlined in the lab document (please include all external functions you create in the *Functions/* folder)
- A detailed report in the *Reports/* folder that matches the requirements specified in the lab assignment document PDF

Students can and should leverage the provided functions and the information in the README. While students are not required to
emulate the exact function names and signatures described in each README, doing so will allow them to compare their work with
the solution code most directly.
